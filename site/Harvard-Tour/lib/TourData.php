Affectionately known as &ldquo;Old Jones,&rdquo; he managed to outwit students every time the bell was in danger. Once, when the hallway to the bell was blocked, he cut a hole in the ceiling to sound it on time. The bell continued to ring until 1933, when, in one of his first acts as University president, James Conant, Class of 1914; Ph.D. 1916, ordered it silenced. Students are now awakened by the 8:40 bell of the Memorial Church. With their extra two hours and 20 minutes of sleep, students are finally able to catch up on well-deserved rest.'
